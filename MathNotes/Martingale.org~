* examples
** sum of r.v.
Even when the series is dependent, we can construct a martingale.
** products of independent r.v.
In Wald's sequential testing theory, we can contruct a LRS to be a
martingale under some testing situation.
** martingale difference
** Doob's martingale
* martingale convergence
