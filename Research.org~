* Current Tasks

** TODO Read the LPD & ROAD papers(do the necessary calculations)and figure out a strategy to establish our result

*** Notion of sparsity, how to measure? When will it preserve?

*** DONE Read Fan's main theorem proof
    CLOSED: [2015-03-28 Sat 14:10] SCHEDULED: <2015-03-21 Sat>
*** Exponential inequalities
Need to figure out how the inequalites in lemma 1 were derived in
LPD paper.

**** DONE Berstein Inequality(2 types of conditions)
     CLOSED: [2015-04-06 Mon 17:01] SCHEDULED: <2015-03-31 Tue>

*** Obtain similar results like (26) and (27) in LPD paper
** comparison of our algorithm with related algorithms like LPD & ROAD
*** what is the pros & cons?

*** TODO Can LPD select the best marginal feature? How about ROAD? [2/3]

**** DONE write down the proof for correlation matrix
     CLOSED: [2015-08-29 Sat 00:15] SCHEDULED: <2015-08-28 Fri>

**** DONE study whether whenever L0 norm = 1, the nonzero feature is the best marginal feature
     CLOSED: [2015-09-09 Wed 16:33] SCHEDULED: <2015-08-28 Fri>
**** TODO try to find counter example for covariance matrix via simulation construction

** implementation of our algorithm

*** DONE nonsingular case
    CLOSED: [2015-08-15 Sat 14:06]

*** TODO singular case
    SCHEDULED: <2015-08-29 Sat>
** TODO Analyze leukemia data
*** Original dataset vs golub dataset in mulltest package?
No conflict, since I found the script which the autors of mulltest used to
preprocess the data into the *golub* dataset in their package.
*** current issues
**** Sig is not p.d., how to get an initial solution
***** TODO idea
      SCHEDULED: <2015-05-15 Fri>
Use the objective function in section 4 of ROAD paper, write it in
regression form then apply lars pacakge to solve an initial solution
for a lambda>0.
**** modify the algorithm for the case with singular Sig matrix
The current update method relies on the invertibility of the active
set covariance matrix.
***** TODO Q: when will the solution be unique when Sig is singular?
Not easy at current stage
      SCHEDULED: <2015-05-16 Sat>
***** DONE When Sig is singular, starting from an initial solution, how to update the optimal solutions and subgradients?
      CLOSED: [2015-04-16 Thu 16:26] SCHEDULED: <2015-04-08 Wed>
For gamma1 vector, it is easy. But for gamma2 vector, how to choose
it?
***** Any matrix decomposition package available in R, matlab?
**** p>3000, computation is slow in R
*** Weighted case vs Equal weight case
**** idea
Read the code of ROAD and see whether we could modify it to use in the
weighted scenario.
*** DONE Cross Validation
    CLOSED: [2015-08-18 Tue 15:34] SCHEDULED: <2015-08-16 Sun>
How to do CV for the current problem?
** TODO Find other implementation code of CLASSO to compare
*** Matlab version for ROAD
*** Tony Cai's LPD
**** DONE Find/write code to solve the LP problem in the paper
     CLOSED: [2015-07-21 Tue 11:40] SCHEDULED: <2015-05-14 Thu>
** estimation of conditional heteroscedastic time series
* Current needed background/technique/skill
** convex optimization(like l0,l1,l2...), KKT condition
*** Langrange Multiplier
to the extent that I can derive the all the dual problems in the
recent papers I read(ROAD,Cai,LARS,etc) swiftly

know how to derive dual form and solve langrange multiplier equations
*** gradient descent
** matrix norms and calculus
** inequalities
*** elementary inequality
*** norm inequality
*** concentration inequality
** asymptotics
*** familiarize with the rate of convergence language
** bayesian
*** BDA book
focus on the examples and the computation chapters
** a plan, 9/3/2015
*** TODO optimization method chapter of Tibshirani's Lasso book, including problems section
    SCHEDULED: <2015-09-06 Sun>
*** notes of duality & penalized regression by advisor
*** multivariate taylor expansion
*** selected sections of Bersekas's book
* Previous work
** Classo Project Special Case

*** DONE Algorithm
    CLOSED: [2015-02-11 Wed 18:42]

*** DONE Matrix Update
    CLOSED: [2015-02-11 Wed 18:42]


*** Algorithm Check
**** Whether the current version is correct
like stopping rule
**** DONE LARS package implementation
   CLOSED: [2015-02-20 Fri 15:14]
using the lars package, for p=4, the number of pieces doesn't meet the expected 42
* Temporary aside
** TODO Gradually export the texmacs version of the CLASSO notes to a latex version
** TODO Think about how to apply our algorithm in classification
** TODO Think about how to modify the algorithm for extension
