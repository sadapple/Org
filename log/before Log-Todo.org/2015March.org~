** TODO Be a better photographer
** TODO Skills to Argue for better travel experience
** Didn't plan in detail for what to do at what time
   I'm the oldest among the three, so I should view it as a
responsibility.
** Check hotel information even if you are not the one who signed
like how many days do they assign the rooms, have coverage for what?
any extra fees? etc.
** Do some study for where to *eat* and *park* if you are in a unfamiliar area
** Food, Water, Sunscreen Cream and Repellent preparation
very important when travelling outdoor
** Intall more apps on the phone which are useful for travel
like google maps, yelp, airline/hotel booking
