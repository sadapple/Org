** rutgers algorithm course
*** leftist tree
Leftist trees are advantageous because of their ability to merge
quickly, compared to binary heaps which take O(n). In almost all
cases, the merging of skew heaps has better performance. However
merging leftist heaps has worst-case O(log n) complexity while merging
skew heaps has only amortized O(log n) complexity.
*** amortizing analysis
*** priority queue
*** binary heap
