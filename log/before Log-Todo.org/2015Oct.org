** prepare
*** TODO think about what materials have important or interesting application in STAT future study
*** materials I can teach that are helpful for my research background study
**** matrix theory, matrix calculus
**** conditional maxima/minimum, multivariate Taylor expansion, Langrangian multipler
**** convex functions, basic optimization theory
**** three different proofs for Basel's Problem
- infinite product expansion of the sin function, then L'Hospital's rule
- same product expansion of sin, then comparing the Taylor's coefficient
  at the 3rd ord
- express the infinite series in terms of two integrations and verify
  they are equal
*** prepare calculus early, half a day every week
