*** what is torque
As you know, an engine’s output is rated in horsepower and
torque. Torque is pulling power, and it’s best demonstrated as the
grunt that gets you moving, while horsepower is what keeps you going.

Without sounding like your high-school physics teacher, torque is the
twisting force created in an engine by rotating parts; horsepower is
the measurement of how fast torque is being used. Horsepower and
torque work hand-in-hand, as horsepower is calculated from torque.

For the average buyer, torque shouldn’t be a deciding factor unless
you know you’ll be towing or hauling heavy loads. And that’s where
high-torque vehicles will thrive, driving while towing a trailer or
maxing out cargo capacity. It will be easier to accelerate and sustain
speed with a high-torque car in any situation, but especially with
heavy loads.
