*** 11.30 Monday
**** Afternoon
Try to say goodbye to Shenzhen by roaming through the area(coco park) where
Dongdong work(after a whimsical BUT successfully search), miraculously receive her wechat message when reaching the
building she works. After some wechat messaging, schedule to have dinner near
her home together. 

Had a far more relaxed and fruitful dinner with her comparing to
yesterday(11.29)'s dinner. Some good and deep discussions on marriage(whether to have
child, etc). What makes me so happy was she took the initiative to talk for many
times during dinner!
