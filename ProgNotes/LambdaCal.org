* General Question: How to define a language?
** My idea
*** basic types
*** operations defined over basic types
*** *binding rules* & *transformation rules* or *substitution rules*
* Can you convey the magic of Lambda Cal in a few sentences?
** the recursive definition of *expression*
** *expression*, *name*, *function*, *application*
