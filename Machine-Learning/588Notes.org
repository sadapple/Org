* LDA vs Logistic Reg
** comparison problem in 588 Hw
*** Findings
**** When delta = 0
If pi=0.5, then the miss rate is very high for both methods. If
pi=0.2, the miss rate is kind of relieved. *Why?*

I think when pi is getting far away from 0.5(in both direction), the
miss rate would be relieved.
**** Fix others, let delta change
delta increase, miss rate decreace, very intuitive
**** Fix others, let dimension p change 
p increase, miss rate for training data tends to decrease, while miss
rate for test data tends to increase. *Why?*
