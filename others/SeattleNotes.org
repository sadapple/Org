* Mountain Rainier
This NP is a must-see when you visit Seattle. Personally, I would
recommend spend at least two days here. A one day trip would be in
quite a hurry.

Maps of this NP could be found [[http://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/upload/MORAmap1.pdf][here]].

** general impression and direction
There are five main areas inside the NP and I've been to four of them
except the *Carbon River* at the NW corner. For a one day trip, I
recommend you to enter the park from the Nisqually entrance at the SW
corner then drive in a anti-clockwise direction so that you would be
able to cover four of the main areas: *Longmire*, *Paradise*, *Ohanapecosh*
and *Sunrise*. If two day trip is probable, I would recommend you to stay
the night in the *Sunrise Day Lodge* / *Paradise Inn* / *National Park
Inn* (I stayed in the middle one last year and which one to choose
depends on your actual site coverage in the 1st day)so that you
would have easy access to potential spectacular views of the mountain
the next morning. We chose the *Paradise Inn* last year, got up
early next day morning and experienced a spectacular view of the
area around mountain rainier after we climbed up along the mountain
ridge near the inn for several hundred meters. You should reserve the Lodging is also
available in Ashford near the NW Nisqually entrance.

The general store at Longmire has good collections of the souvenir and
supplies, check it out if you have time. Gas is not available in the
park, so it would be good idea to fill up the car tank at Ashford or
Elbe(if you enter from SW). For the parking, we had a hard time to
park at *Paradise*, but in other lots, we parked easily.

Mosquitoes are common during summer time and might be annoying, so
bring some repellent if you can.

For the weather of the area, check [[http://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/weather.htm][here.]] Since the condition there can
change rapidly, make sure to check it out the night before your next
day's visit. Last year when we left the park, we saw lenticular cloud
over Mountain Rainier, which is very interesting. I heard from Jiyou
that it is usually a sign for rain within 24 hours :)

And I should remind you one more thing, since Mountain Rainier is
still active, you may want to pick up some signs for potential threat
for eruption(like rock flow, rumbling noise, water level rise, etc.).

** viewpoint recommendation

*** Longmire
There is museum here which has nice exhibits on geology and ecology
of that area. You can also find road and weather information here.

Near the museum, there is a path which leads to Longmire meadow where
you can enjoy a great view of the mountain. Also a good place for
sunset. You might see deers and many wild flowers in the
meadow. *Trail of the Shadows* loops around the meadow and is relatively
short(0.7 mile after checking). There are also harder trails in this
area but I guess you are reluctant to try.

On the way to *Paradise*, you can find parking lots for access to
*Christine Falls* and *Narada Falls*, check out the map for the rough
location.

*** Paradise
According to me, this is the most crowded place in the park. But the
scene in this area is really spectacular. I vaguely remember the name
of this place comes from someone's first impression of the meadow
flowers there.

The peak of the flowers there is usually July to early August. My
Jiyou loves plants and I learned to indentify some of the flowers
there from him. In my memory, you would be able to see [[http://www.mountainscenes.com/images/rainier/RAI.2149.html][lupine]], [[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/slideshow/Final-days-of-wildflowers-at-Mount-Rainier-113133.php][paintbrush]], bear grass, [[http://photoseek.photoshelter.com/image/I0000TpbePR_bZAA][avalanche lily]] and many others during
this season.


If you have time, try the *Nisqually Vista Trial* and *Skyline Trial*
in this area which are all relative short.

*** Reflection Lake
This place is great for taking photos, must check it out, especially
great for sunrise! [[http://trumpetnista.tumblr.com/post/56297991243/djferreira224-sunrise-mt-rainier-reflected-in][Sample photo online]]. The flowers here are fewer
than the flowers at *Paradise*.

*** Stevens Canyon
Few iconic view in this area, but many viewpoint in this area
is easy to access from the road.

*** Sunrise
On the road from Stevens Canyon to Sunrise, you might want to check
out the *Tipsoo Lake* which might also give you a great view for the
mountain and flowers. [[http://i.imgur.com/MimH8Ky.jpg][Sample photo]].

*Sunrise* area is an awesome place to check at sunrise and is also a good
place to see flowers. Near the *Sunrise Visitor Center*, you can check
out great views of Mountain Rainier above the *White River
Valley*. Also check out *Emmons Vista Lookout*(Emmons is a glacier
name) after a short walk from the parking lot. The view gets even
better if you head to *Sunrise Rim Trail* from the Vista lookout.

The *Berkeley Park* there is great for flowers but the hike trip is
quite long(I didn't
finish). [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/vtgohokies/4875362305][Sample photo]].

** conclusion and others
If you only have one day, according to my point of view, you must
check out the *Paradise* and *Sunrise* area. The *Reflection Lake* is
also a must-see. If you don't plan to try any trails(which is a pity
since some of the trails is great to see wildflowers!) and don't spend
too much time for photographing, you should be able to cover at least
3 of the 5 viewpoint areas that I mentioned above.
