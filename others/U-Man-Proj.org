*** Varying follow-up time due to enrollment, e.g., Uniform distribution instead of constant administrative censoring
*** Incorporate simulation data generation of pragmatic trial in addition to what was already incorporated, re: Skeviâ€™s R code
*** Criteria for evaluating the methods, e.g., power
** 8.5
*** a unified function to produce the results of six methods for the same data simulated
* Questions
** What allocation mechanism is realistic for our project? for pragmatic trial
* Aside
** time-dependent trial framework [0/2] 
*** TODO how to simulate the outcome & covariates 
SCHEDULED: <2016-02-09 Tue>
in our case, do we need to simulate random effects at each time point?
*** TODO how to model the simulated data
