* Afterwords

"I Left home when a mere stripling,and returned in old age". Just like
this Chinese old saying goes, I returned to work for Ningdu, my second
hometown where I was educated, enlightened and motivated to chase my
dream, when I was nearly fifty. And I do feel honored and cherish this
chance.

Set to be Xian("county" in English) during the three kingdoms period, Zhou during the Yuan &
Qing dynasty, Special District during the Republic of China and
beginning of the PRC period, Ningdu is a place with deep cultural
characteristics and deposits.
