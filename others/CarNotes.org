** gear ratio
The gear ratio of a gear train, also known as its speed ratio, is the
ratio of the angular velocity of the input gear to the angular
velocity of the output gear. The gear ratio can be calculated
directly from the numbers of teeth on the gears in the gear train.
** CVT
is an automatic transmission that can change seamlessly through an
infinite number of effective gear ratios between maximum and minimum
values. This contrasts with other mechanical transmissions that offer
a fixed number of gear ratios. The flexibility of a CVT allows the
input shaft to maintain a constant angular velocity.
