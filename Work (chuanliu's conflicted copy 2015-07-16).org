** Question Class
*** Questions about resume and past experience
Intern experience, research assistant projects,
Make sure you know your CV/resume well -- they can ask you anything on there
!
Experience/ projects
1)	3-4 sentence high level summary,
a)	goal of study,
b)	analysis, model,
c)	results.
2)	The most interesting part in the project
3)	Details if asked

**** Use the STAR technique
1. Situation: Open with a brief description of the Situation and context of
the story (who, what, where, when, how).
2. Task: Explain the Task you had to complete highlighting any specific
challenges or constraint (eg deadlines, costs, other issues).
3. Action: Describe the specific Actions that you took to complete the task.
These should highlight desirable traits without needing to state them (
initiative, intelligence, dedication, leadership, understanding, etc.)
4. Result: Close with the result of your efforts. Include figures to
quantify the result if possible.

*** Describe your dissertation
No formula, no tools, describe your dissertation in an intuitive way in 1-2
mins.
Eg. what is the motivation (motivating dataset), the problem with current
approach, the new method you propose, what is new and what is better.
Can draw on paper to explain if necessary.
*** Techinical questions
Different phases of clinical trials,
survival analysis (write down the partial likelihood;Explain hazard ratio to
non-statistician;Kaplan-Mier curve;Cox proportional hazard model;Log rank
test),
adaptive bayesian designs,
Basic design of experiments.

**** The most commonly asked: explain certain concepts to non-statistician (p-
values, CI, controlling for multiplicity)
*** Behavior questions
The most commonly asked:
Tell me about yourself
why industry and not academia,
why our company and not other pharma,
How do you like team work,
how do handle pressure,
how do you meet deadlines,
how do you handle different projects at same time,
what is your expectation,
how do you want to look yourself after 5 years ...../ how do you see
yourself in 5 years.
What will your boss/colleagues/advisor say about you
What is your greatest strength and weakness

**** You need solid examples from past experience to support each point.

*** Questions to ask the interviewer
For the Hiring manager (who make the decision):
major responsibility for this project, what kind of projects, job specific
questions
For other people:
1.	What is your typical day like?
2.	What projects are you working on, which phases,
3.	Major diff between pharma and other area,
4.	What do you think makes a good biostatistician (in a biotech company/
pharma) ?
5.	What are your top 5 predictions for the next 20 years?
6.	how they got into the industry (why did THEY not choose academia),
7.	what they like and not like about the job (don't be afraid to build a "
close" relationship with them by asking them questions that may get them out
of their comfort zone),
8.	what do they have in terms of advice for a new PhD graduate, etc.

**** Ask questions so that you can show your strength!
* Find a good starting job
** What job do you want and what choice do you have
A job which I could apply my knowledge about stat modelling and interpretation, like in
finance or IT area.
** What to apply and how to apply
** To be a sound candidate
