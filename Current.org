* What's the most important thing for my current state of life?

** Research (Want to graduate as a good Phd? Only via Hard Work!)

Accumulate sufficient knowledge about high dim statitical analysis.
Plan:


*** TODO Read the related materials in ESL thoroughly and repeatedly

Ch3 Penalized Regression
Ch4 Classification
Model Assessment and Selection
Model Inference and Averaging

Clustering
SVM
Trees and random forest
Boosting

Bootstrap
EM
*** TODO Be more familiar with nonlinear programming theory and examples
*** TODO Matrix calculus & Random matrix theory

** Computing (Be a better programmer)
*** What does a good program mean?
Well structured, each piece has its meaning and might be adapt to
other programs.

Well commented and documented.

*** How to write good programs?
First Principle: GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY!

*** Any general principles?
Use means of combination and means of abstraction to control the
complexity of the computing problem.

*Learn to problem in a problem/project/target orientated way, do not mess up with the details without a direction*
*Learn from expereienced people around you*

*** TODO Think about what abilities and tools does a data analyst/scientist nowadays  need to know and master
Data processing? Cleaning?
Hadoop? Map reduce?

*** R & SAS expertise
For R, learn some useful packages like dplyr, ggplot2, reshape. Know
the limitations of R. Also, at some point, learn the interaction of R
with other languages like Cpp, Python, SQL etc.  For both, learn how
to process large data set.

*** Python
Q:When is Python better than R?

*** C++
Pointer, Inheritence, Template, void function.

** Job

*** CV Writing
*** Build connections
*** Accumulate informations
Website?
BBS?
Friends?

* current strength and weakness
** strength
Still have some curiosity and open mind.
Have the will to discovery and dive into the details for the things I like.
** weakness
*** LAZY, lack of audacity and persistence, "Eyes are high while Hands are low..."
*** too sensitive
what are you afraid of?? Job? Status? Love?
Just remember, ultimately, it is a from dust to dust journey!
*** occational self-constrain and pride (*Ask help from peers/friends whenever possible and neccessary*, this might save a lot of time)
*** lack of effective communication(oral & written) skill
*** think about possession too much/have some desires, sometimes

* current motivation

** Programming is fun
*** What does a good program generally exhibit?
*** What skills do you need to present as a good programmer?
*** TODO Fun/Good program example accumulating!
** Stat is fun
*** Use examples/data together with concise(but sharp) explanations to illustrate/defend a point/argument
Good example: <under the dome> by Chai Jing
*** See through fake/wrong conclusions draw from data
Good example: Simpson's paradox
*** An ideal condition would be able to see whether the conclusion drawing from data analysis is reliable or not
*** Data Mining
Classification Rules
When will Bayes Rule be good?
** Math is fun
*** strategies in game theory, statistics(see Ferguson's math stat book) and daily life
** Emacs, Linux, anything that is clever, playful and fun
** Body training
*** Hiking
*** Basketball
** Friends, like She tou & Tao zi
** Critical thinking
* current guiding principle

** Ping Chang Xin, Beyond Feelings
** Less is more
** If...Then...
** March forward, but revisit regularly to gain confidence
** Trinity: Body, Skill, Heart
** Trinity: Statistics, Mathematics, Programming
** Love yourself, concentrate on your own stuff, stay focused
** Know more things about the finance,  economics. Try apply to daily life.

* Daily Time Analysis
** March 2nd 2015
1. sleep : 6-7 hours, weekend could be longer
2. cook and eat : 2 hours
3. exercise : minimum 45 minutes
4. road time : 30 minutes
5. email time : 30 minutes
6. dressing, bathing, teeth brushing, face washing, shopping etc :
   maximum 1.25 hour average
7. remaining time for other things : 12 hours
*** How to spend the remaining time?
**** Routine Habit Time
1 hour problem solving everyday
30 minutes minimum for visual memory and meditation
**** Mon
1:30 hours for holding the office hour
**** Tuesday
need 3-4 hours to prepare the lecture
**** Wed
1 hour for meeting with advisor
**** Thur
**** Fri
3 hours for Inference course
1 hour video chatting with parents
**** Sat
**** Sun
30 minutes call with Leila
**** Conclusion
All the previous entries would consume 1.5*7+11=21.5 hours, the
remaining hours would be 12*7-21.5=62.5 hours per week, 9 hours per day.

** good habit, good expression
*** morning and night
get up around 7am, go to sleep around 1am
In the morning, consider recite some good paragraphs I read recently.
Before sleep, try to solve some problems(could be research related or
just brain speed training) or practise virtual memorization.
*** *Make deep meditation and calculations as an Conditioned Reflex*
*** Find a suitable topic to express yourself(could be written/oral) *faithfullly* & *efficiently* everyday!
*** Find good problem/project to challenge myself(programming, math, stat or anything interesting) regularly
*** Realize at many occassions, the thing you feel reluctant to do is the exactly the thing you should do first!

** learn the tao of Fun & Humor!
*** What things are truly fun or humorous?
*** Accumulate fun/humorous materials

** Representations
*** An appetite of solving problems by hand or by mental calculation
*** A belief/desire to find you own answers, a belief to drill deep and be crystally clear

*** Persistent and Consistent
*** Make connections and analogies regularly
** Plan

*** Plan longer time for daily meditation and problem solving
Check emails and wechat less often. For emails/wechat, I could do it in a 4
times a day fashion: morning, noon, afternoon and night.
*** Improve efficiency
Try study and research in a project and problem driving manner. Avoid/Postpone
relative unimportant problems and distractions even for those which
are interesting.
*** Communication
Don't hesitate to ask dumb questions before fellow students. Don't
reserve your understanding for a problem for most people who want to
know your perspectives.
Don't hesitate to take the initiative when meeting the advisor. Don't
hesitate to present the points which block you for some time.
